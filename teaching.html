					<h3>IMLS Building Institutional Capacity Grant</h3>
					<p>The Geographic Information Librarianship (GIL) project was a two-year curricular research collaboration between the University of Tennessee and Drexel University. In 2012, Tony Grubesic, Ph.D. and Wade Bishop were awarded the Laura Bush 21st Century Librarian Program grant via the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). The grant amount was awarded at $345,270.</p>
					<p>The GIL project bolstered spatial data management and preservation of resources created by an array of geospatial tools. The goal of the grant was to formally integrate Geographic Information Systems (GIS) into library and information science (LIS) curricula. The project objectives were (1) to create two online courses; (2) to conduct a survey validation study of the knowledge, skills, and abilities to do GIL; and (3) to increase GIS related research in LIS.</p>
