This includes the Research Data Management (RDM) of geospatial data, <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/766315">data disovery</a>, <a href="https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pra2.4">information-seeking behavior of scientists</a>, <a href="https://datascience.codata.org/articles/10.5334/dsj-2023-002">data management plans</a>, as well as <a href="https://utpjournals.press/doi/10.3138/jelis-2021-0023">job analyses</a> of data managers facilitating research data services. Also, I use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to <a href="https://www.libres-ejournal.info/1037">spatially analyze public library</a> locations, market areas, and information agency services and resources. Here are links to my profiles in <a href="https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=24469564000">Scopus</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=57CJCi8AAAAJ&hl=en">Google Scholar</a>.</p>
					<p>Geographic information generally consists of facts, data and/or evidence pertaining to events, activities, and things located on (or near) the surface of the Earth. The processes by which humans chose to organize, access, and use geospatial data are fundamental to many sciences and our everyday lives.  Whether the data reuse is to inform facility location decisions, efficiently distribute vaccines, or to quickly navigate a new space, geographic information is essential.  The field of Information Science provides a multidisciplinary lens to systematically study geospatial data, its special properties, and how it is discovered and evaluated for re-use.</p>
					<p>Data occupations, education, and training studies addresses the curricular needs to meet employment demands for knowledge workers in the areas of science data and its management throughout the research lifecycle. In order to support this rapid growth of jobs in these areas a workforce is needed that will be trained not only in geospatial technologies, but its organization, access, and use.  The IMLS projects Collaborative Analysis Liaison Librarians (CALL) and Geographic Information Librarianship (GIL) both included survey validations and interviews of current professionals to inform course development and now has resulted in three electives offered at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville School of Information Sciences and a <a href="https://sis.utk.edu/exploreprograms/masters/career-pathway-geographic-information">Geographic Information pathway</a>. Professionals working in museums, libraries, archives, and data centers act as stewards and intermediaries to a rich variety of geospatial data and with shifting user needs and data types further job analyses work will be conducted to better understand all the occupations to produce applicable education and training (e.g. earth scientists, biologists, and so forth).</p>
